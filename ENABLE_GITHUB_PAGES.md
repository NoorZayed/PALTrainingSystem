# 🚀 URGENT: Enable GitHub Pages - Step by Step

## 🔴 Current Status: 404 Error
Your site shows 404 because GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet. Follow these exact steps:

## ✅ Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Required)

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/NoorZayed/PALTrainingSystem
2. **Click "Settings"** tab (top right of your repo)
3. **Scroll down** to find "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. **Click "Pages"**

## ✅ Step 2: Configure Pages Source

1. **Under "Source"** select: **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT Deploy from a branch)
2. **Save** the settings
3. You should see: "GitHub Pages will build and deploy..."

## ✅ Step 3: Trigger Deployment

1. **Go to "Actions"** tab: https://github.com/NoorZayed/PALTrainingSystem/actions
2. **Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages"** workflow
3. **Click "Run workflow"** (green button on the right)
4. **Click "Run workflow"** again to confirm

## ✅ Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. **Monitor the workflow** (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. **Look for green checkmark** ✅
3. **Your site will be live** at: https://noorzayed.github.io/PALTrainingSystem

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Deployment

If the above doesn't work, try this:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/noorzayed/Documents/PALTrainingSystem

# Remove any existing gh-pages deployment
git branch -D gh-pages 2>/dev/null || true

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy manually (without LFS files)
npx gh-pages -d build --no-history
```

## 🎯 What Should Happen

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- GitHub Actions workflow completes with green checkmark
- Pages settings show: "Your site is live at https://noorzayed.github.io/PALTrainingSystem"
- Site loads without 404 error

### ❌ If Still 404:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
2. Try incognito/private browser window
3. Check Actions tab for any red X (failed builds)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GitHub Actions" not available in Source dropdown
**Solution**: Make sure you have the workflow file committed (we just did this)

### Issue: Workflow fails with permissions error
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select "Read and write permissions"
4. Save

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**: The warnings in the build are normal, they won't prevent deployment
